  <h2>How to Choose the Right Laptop</h2>

  <p>
    When picking a laptop for school, focus on what you’ll actually use every day —
    not marketing hype.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> 8–16GB RAM and SSD storage for smooth multitasking</li>
    <li><strong>Battery life:</strong> Aim for at least 8 hours per charge</li>
    <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Lightweight laptops are easier to carry all day</li>
    <li><strong>Durability:</strong> A solid build helps the laptop last through years of use</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    For most students, expensive gaming laptops or premium features aren’t necessary.
    A reliable mid-range laptop will comfortably handle coursework, research,
    and entertainment.
